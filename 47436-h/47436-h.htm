<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The project of the American Journal of Science and Arts was
first suggested by Col. Gibbs, in November, 1817, during an accidental
interview on board the steamboat Fulton in Long Island
Sound.<a id="rn_1" name="rn_1" href="#fn_1"><span class="noteref">1</span></a> The American Mineralogical Journal, by the late Dr.
Archibald Bruce, (our earliest purely scientific journal,) which had
been begun a few years before, was most favorably received both
at home and abroad, but it never passed beyond one volume of 270
pages; and as the declining health of Dr. Bruce rendered the prospect
of its continuance hopeless, it was thought that we ought
not to lose the advantage already gained, and that a high demand
of duty required that some man devoted to science, should undertake
to sustain its interests and those of the connected arts, in
our rising country. Although a different selection of an editor
would have been much preferred, and many reasons, public and
personal, concurred to produce diffidence of success, the arguments
of Col. Gibbs, whose views on subjects of science were
entitled to the most respectful consideration, and had justly great
weight, being pressed with zeal and ability, induced a reluctant
assent; and accordingly, after due consultation with many
competent judges, the proposals were issued early in 1818, embracing
the whole range of physical science and its applications.
The Editor in entering on the duty, regarded it as an
affair for life, and the thirty years of experience which he has
now had, have proved that his views of the exigencies of the
service were not erroneous.</p>

<p>This Journal first appeared in July, 1818, and in June, 1819,
the first volume of four numbers and 448 pages was completed.
This scale of publication, originally deemed sufficient, was found
inadequate to receive all the communications, and as the receipts
proved insufficient to sustain the expenses, the work, having but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
three hundred and fifty subscribers, was, at the end of the year,
abandoned by the publishers.</p>

<p>An unprofitable enterprise not being attractive to the trade,
ten months elapsed before another arrangement could be carried
into effect, and therefore No. 1 of Vol. ii was not published until
April, 1820. The new arrangement was one of mutual responsibility
for the expenses, but the Editor was constrained nevertheless
to pledge his own personal credit to obtain from a bank
the funds necessary to begin again, and from this responsibility
he was, for a series of years, seldom released. The single volume
per annum being found insufficient for the communications, two
volumes a year were afterwards published, commencing with the
second volume.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of Vol. x, in February, 1826, the work was
again left upon the hands of its Editor; all its receipts had been
absorbed by the expenses, and it became necessary now to pay a
heavy sum to the retiring publisher, as an equivalent for his copies
of previous volumes, as it was deemed necessary either to control
the work entirely or to abandon it. The Editor was not willing to
think of the latter, especially as he was encouraged by public approbation,
and was cheered onward in his labors by eminent men
both at home and abroad, and he saw distinctly that the Journal
was rendering service not only to science and the arts, but to the
reputation of his country. He reflected moreover that in almost
every valuable enterprise perseverance in effort is necessary to
success. He being now sole proprietor, a new arrangement was
made for a single year, the publishers being at liberty, at the end
of that time, to retire, and the Editor to resume the Journal
should he prefer that course.</p>

<p>The latter alternative he adopted, taking upon himself the entire
concern, including both the business and the editorial duties,
and of course, all the correspondence and accounts. From that
time the work has proceeded without interruption, two volumes
per annum having been published for the last twenty years; and
its pecuniary claims ceased to be onerous, although its means
have never been large.</p>

<p>Forty-nine volumes having been published, ending with Number
100, October, 1845, it was deemed expedient to close the<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
series with a fiftieth volume, which should contain an ample
and well digested <span class="smcap">Index</span> of the whole. This great labor, vastly
more arduous and protracted than had been anticipated, is at last
accomplished. The strict verification of every reference in this
Index, by actual comparison of the proof with the volume and
page, has been a labor surpassed only by the toil of constructing
the Index itself. The printing was commenced in October, 1846,
and so toilsome and time-consuming has been the correction of
the proofs, that although the work has gone steadily forward,
without interruption, it is only at this late day completed. We
may confidently believe that the volume will prove useful, not
only to those who may possess the whole series, but to all who
are connected in any way with the arts or sciences; for, whatever
the department, the reader is directed by it to the various
memoirs that have been published in the Journal on the subject
that interests him, whether relating to the progress of science, to
details of facts in the different departments of knowledge, or to
the various resources of this and other countries: with such a
guide, the entire copies of the work in public libraries or in those
of individuals, become available.</p>

<p>As this volume may be consulted by many who have never
seen the plan and prospectus of the Journal with which the
first volume began, we republish, on this occasion, both the
"Plan of the Work," and also those parts of the "Introductory
Remarks" in which our early views were explained. Our readers
will thus be able to judge how far we have fulfilled our engagements,
and also how far our prospective views have been realized
in the course of our now long experience. They will have
moreover before them in this Prospectus of 1817, the principles
that are still to guide us in our continued editorial labors.</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">plan of the work.</span><a id="rn_2" name="rn_2" href="#fn_2"><span class="noteref">2</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This Journal is intended to embrace the circle of the <span class="smcap">Physical
Sciences</span>, with their applications to the <span class="smcap">Arts</span>, and to every
useful purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>


<p>It is designed as a deposit for original American communications;
but will contain also occasional selections from Foreign
Journals, and notices of the progress of Science in other countries.</p>

<p>Within its plan are embraced,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Natural History</span>, in its three great departments of <span class="smcap">Mineralogy</span>,
<span class="smcap">Botany</span> and <span class="smcap">Zoology</span>:&ndash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chemistry</span> and <span class="smcap">Natural Philosophy</span>, in their various branches;
and <span class="smcap">Mathematics</span>, pure and mixed.</p>

<p>It will be a leading object to illustrate <span class="smcap">American Natural History</span>,
and especially our <span class="smcap">Mineralogy</span> and <span class="smcap">Geology</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Applications</span> of these sciences are obviously as numerous
as physical arts and physical wants; for no one of these arts or
wants can be named which is not connected with them.</p>

<p>While <span class="smcap">Science</span> will be cherished <i>for its own sake</i>, and with a
due respect for its own inherent dignity; it will also be employed
as the handmaid to the Arts. Its numerous applications to <span class="smcap">Agriculture</span>,
the earliest and most important of them; to our <span class="smcap">Manufactures</span>
both mechanical and chemical; and to our <span class="smcap">Domestic
Economy</span>, will be carefully sought out, and faithfully made.</p>

<p>It is also within the design of this Journal to receive communications
on <span class="smcap">Music</span>, <span class="smcap">Sculpture</span>, <span class="smcap">Engraving</span>, <span class="smcap">Painting</span>, and generally
on the fine and liberal, as well as useful arts:&ndash;</p>

<p>On Military and Civil Engineering, and the art of Navigation:&ndash;</p>

<p>Notices, Reviews and Analyses of new scientific works, and of
new Inventions, and Specifications of Patents:&ndash;</p>

<p>Bibliographical and Obituary Notices of scientific men; essays
on Comparative Anatomy and Physiology, and generally on such
other branches of medicine as depend on scientific principles:&ndash;</p>

<p>Meteorological Registers, and Reports of Agricultural Experiments:
and we would leave room also for interesting miscellaneous
things, not exactly included under either of the above heads.</p>

<p>Communications are respectfully solicited from men of science,
and from men versed in the practical arts.</p>

<p>Learned Societies are invited to make this Journal, occasionally,
the vehicle of their communications to the public.</p>

<p>The Editor will not hold himself responsible for the sentiments
and opinions advanced by his correspondents; but he will consider
it as an allowed liberty to make slight verbal alterations,
where errors may be presumed to have arisen from inadvertency."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">introductory remarks.</span></p>

<p>"The age in which we live is not less distinguished by a vigorous
and successful cultivation of physical science, than by its numerous
and important applications to the practical arts, and to
the common purposes of life.</p>

<p>"In every enlightened country, men illustrious for talent, worth,
and knowledge, are ardently engaged in enlarging the boundaries
of natural science; and the history of their labors and discoveries
is communicated to the world chiefly through the medium of
Scientific Journals. The utility of such Journals has thus become
generally evident; they are the heralds of science; they
proclaim its toils and its achievements; they demonstrate its intimate
connexion as well with the comfort, as with the intellectual
and moral improvement of our species; and they often procure
for it enviable honors and substantial rewards.</p>

<p>"In England, the interests of science have been, for a series of
years, greatly promoted by the excellent Journals of Tilloch and
Nicholson; and for the loss of the latter, the scientific world has
been fully compensated by Dr. Thomson's Annals of Philosophy,
and by the Journal of Science and the Arts, both published
in London.</p>

<p>"In France, the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, the Journal
des Mines, the Journal de Physique, &amp;c. have long enjoyed a
high and deserved reputation. Indeed, there are few countries
in Europe which do not produce some similar publication; not
to mention the transactions of learned societies and numerous
medical journals.</p>

<p>"From these sources <i>our</i> country reaps, and will long continue
to reap, an abundant harvest of information: and if the light of
science, as well as of day, springs from the east, we will welcome
the rays of both; nor should national pride induce us to
reject so rich an offering.</p>

<p>"But can we do nothing in return?</p>

<p>"In a general diffusion of useful information through the various
classes of society, in activity of intellect, and fertility of resource
and invention, producing a highly intelligent population,
we have no reason to shrink from a comparison with any country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
But the devoted cultivators of science in the United States,
are comparatively few; they are, however, rapidly increasing in
number. Among them are persons distinguished for their capacity
and attainments, and, notwithstanding the local feelings nourished
by our state sovereignties, and the rival claims of several
of our larger cities, there is evidently a predisposition towards a
concentration of effort, from which we may hope for the happiest
results, with regard to the advancement of both the science
and reputation of our country.</p>

<p>"Is it not, therefore, desirable to furnish some rallying point,
some object sufficiently interesting to be nurtured by common
efforts, and thus to become the basis of an enduring, common
interest? To produce these efforts, and to excite this interest,
nothing, perhaps, bids fairer than a <span class="smcap">Scientific Journal</span>.</p>

<p>"No one, it is presumed, will doubt that a Journal devoted to
science, and embracing a sphere sufficiently extensive to allure
to its support the principal scientific men of our country, is greatly
needed; if cordially supported, it will be successful, and if successful,
it will be a great public benefit.</p>

<p>"Even a failure, in so good a cause, (unless it should arise from
incapacity or unfaithfulness,) cannot be regarded as dishonorable.
It may prove only that the attempt was <i>premature</i>, and that our
country is not yet ripe for such an undertaking; for <i>without the
efficient support of talent, knowledge</i>, and <i>money, it cannot long
proceed</i>. No editor can hope to carry forward such a work without
the active aid of scientific and practical men; but, at the same
time, the public have a right to expect that he will not be sparing
of his own labor, and that his work shall be generally marked by
the impress of his own hand. To this extent the editor cheerfully
acknowledges his obligations to the public; and it will be
his endeavor faithfully to redeem his pledge.</p>

<p>"Most of the periodical works of our country have been short-lived.
<i>This</i>, also, <i>may</i> perish in its infancy; and if any degree
of confidence is cherished that it will attain a maturer age, it is
derived from the obvious and intrinsic importance of the undertaking;
from its being built upon permanent and momentous
national interests; from the evidence of a decided approbation of
the design, on the part of gentlemen of the first eminence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
obtained in the progress of an extensive correspondence; from
assurances of support, in the way of contributions, from men of
ability in many sections of the union; and from the existence of
<i>such a crisis</i> in the affairs of this country and of the world, as
appears peculiarly auspicious to the success of every wise and
good undertaking.</p>

<p>"As regards the subjects of the contemplated work, it is not in
our power to do much in the department of the natural history of
this country. Our Zoology has been more fully investigated
than our mineralogy and botany; but neither department is in
danger of being exhausted. The interesting travels of Lewis
and Clark have recently brought to our knowledge several plants
and animals before unknown. Foreign naturalists are frequently
exploring our territory; and, for the most part, convey to Europe
the fruits of their researches, while but a small part of our own
productions is examined and described by Americans: certainly,
this is little to our credit, and still less to our advantage. Honorable
exceptions to the truth of this remark are furnished by the
exertions of some gentlemen in our principal cities, and in various
other parts of the Union.</p>

<p>"Our botany, it is true, has been extensively and successfully
investigated; but this field is still <i>rich</i>, and rewards every new
research with some interesting discovery. Our mineralogy, however,
is a treasure but just opened. That both science and art
may expect much advantage from this source, is sufficiently
evinced by the success which has crowned the active efforts of a
few ardent cultivators of this science: several new species have
been added to it in this country; great numbers of American localities
of minerals discovered, and interesting additions made to
our materials, for the useful and ornamental arts.</p>

<p>"Mineralogy is most intimately connected with our arts, and
especially with agriculture. Such are the disguises worn by
many most useful mineral substances, that an unskilful observer
is liable to pass a thing by, as worthless, which, if better informed,
he would seize with avidity; and, still more frequently, a
worthless substance, clothed perhaps in a brilliant and attractive
exterior, excites hopes altogether delusive, and induces expense,
without a possibility of remuneration. A diffusion of correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
knowledge on this subject is the only adequate remedy for
either evil.</p>

<p>"Our geology, also, presents a most interesting field of inquiry.
A grand outline has recently been drawn by Mr. Maclure, with a
masterly hand, and with a vast extent of personal observation and
labor: but to fill up the detail, both observation and labor still
more extensive are demanded; nor can the object be effected till
more good geologists are formed, and distributed over our extensive
territory.</p>

<p>"To account for the formation and changes of our globe, by
excursions of the imagination, often splendid and imposing, but
usually visionary, and almost always baseless, was, till within
half a century, the business of geological speculations; but this
research has now assumed a more sober character; the science
of geology has been reared upon numerous and accurate observations
of <i>facts</i>; and standing thus upon the basis of induction, it
is entitled to a rank among those sciences which Lord Bacon's
Philosophy has contributed to create.</p>

<p>"The outlines of American geology appear to be particularly
grand, simple, and instructive; and a knowledge of the important
facts, and general principles of this science, is of vast practical
use, as regards the interests of agriculture, and the research
for useful minerals. Geological and mineralogical descriptions,
and maps of particular states and districts, are very much needed
in the United States; and to excite a spirit to furnish them will
form one leading object of the contemplated journal.</p>

<p>"The science of natural philosophy, with its powerful auxiliary
mathematics, and the science of chemistry, the twin sister of
natural philosophy, are of incalculable importance to this country.
A volume would not suffice to trace their applications, and
to enumerate the instances of their utility.</p>

<p>"As one which may be allowed to stand, <i>instar omnium</i>, we
may mention the steam engine; that legitimate child of physical
and chemical science&ndash;at once more powerful than the united
force of the strongest and largest animals, and more manageable
than the smallest and gentlest; raising from the bowels of the
earth the massy treasures of its mines, drawing up rivers from
their channels, and pouring them, in streams of life, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
bosom of cities; and, above all, propelling against the currents,
the winds, and the waves, of the ocean, those stupendous vessels,
which combine speed with certainty, and establish upon the
bosom of the deep the luxuries and accommodations of the land.</p>

<p>"The successful execution of this magnificent design was first
effected by Fulton and witnessed upon the waters of the Hudson,
but is now imitated in almost every civilized country; and
it remains to be seen whether steam will be applied in war.</p>

<p>"The mechanical inventions of this country are numerous;
many of them are ingenious, and some are highly important.
In no way can a knowledge of them be so readily and extensively
diffused as in a scientific journal. To this object, therefore,
a part of our labors (should there be a call for it) will be
devoted, and every necessary aid will be given by plates and descriptions.</p>

<p>"Science and art mutually assist each other; the arts furnish
facts and materials to science, and science illuminates the path
of the arts.</p>

<p>"Geometry, and mathematics both pure and mixed, can never
cease to be interesting and important to man, as long as the relations
of quantity shall exist, as long as ships shall traverse the
ocean, as long as man shall measure the surface or heights of the
earth on which he lives, or calculate the distances and examine
the relations of the planets and stars; and as long as the iron
reign of war shall demand the discharge of projectiles, or the
construction of complicated defenses.</p>

<p>"In a word, the whole circle of physical science is directly applicable
to human wants, and constantly holds out a light to the
practical arts; it thus polishes and benefits society, and every
where demonstrates both supreme intelligence, and harmony and
beneficence of design in the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the pledge which, on entering upon our editorial labors
in 1818, we gave to the public, and such were the views which
we then entertained, regarding science and the arts as connected
with the interests and honor of our country and of mankind. In
the retrospect, we realize a sober but grateful feeling of satisfaction,
in having, to the extent of our power, discharged these self-imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
obligations; this feeling is chastened also by a deep sense
of gratitude, first, to God for life and power continued for so high a
purpose; and next, to our noble band of contributors, whose labors
are recorded in half a century of volumes, and in more than a quarter
of a century of years. We need not conceal our conviction, that
the views expressed in these "Introductory Remarks," have been
fully sustained by our fellow laborers.</p>

<p>Should we appear to take higher ground than becomes us, we
find our vindication in the fact, that we have heralded chiefly the
doings and the fame of others. The work has indeed borne
throughout "the impress" of editorial unity of design, and much
that has flowed from one pen, and not a little from the pens of
others, has been without a name. The materials for the pile,
have however been selected and brought in, chiefly by other
hands, and if the monument which has been reared should
prove to be "<i>ære perennius</i>," the honor is not the sole property
of the architect; those who have quarried, hewn and polished
the granite and the marble, are fully entitled to the enduring record
of their names already deeply cut into the massy blocks,
which themselves have furnished.</p>

<p>If a retrospective survey of the labors of thirty years, on this
occasion, has rekindled a degree of enthusiasm, it is the natural
result of an examination of all our volumes, from the contents of
which we have endeavored to make out a summary both of the
laborers and their works.</p>

<p>We find that there have been about 600 contributors of original
matter to the Journal, and we have the unexpected satisfaction
of believing that probably five-sixths of them are still living;
for we are not certain that more than fifty are among the dead;
of perhaps fifty more we are without information, and if that additional
number is to be enrolled among the "stelligeri," we have still
500 remaining. Among them are not a few of the veterans with
whom we began our career, and several of these are still active
contributors. Shall we then conclude that the peaceful pursuits
of knowledge are favorable to long life? This we think is, <i>cæteris
paribus</i>, certainly true: but in the present instance, another
reason can be assigned for the large amount of survivorship. As
the Journal has advanced and death has removed its scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
contributors, younger men and men still younger, have recruited
the ranks, and volunteers have enlisted in numbers constantly increasing,
so that the flower of the host are now in the morning
and meridian of life.</p>

<p>We have been constantly advancing, like a traveller from
the equinoctial towards the colder zones,&ndash;as we have increased
our latitude, stars have set and new stars have risen, while a few
planetary orbs visible in every zone, have continued to cheer us
on our course.</p>

<p>The number of articles, almost exclusively original, contained
in the Journal is about 1800, and the Index will show how
many have been contributed by each individual; we have doubtless
included in this number <i>some few</i> articles republished from
foreign Journals&ndash;but we think they are even more than counterbalanced
by original communications without a name and by
editorial articles, both of which have been generally omitted in
the enumeration.</p>

<p>Of smaller articles and notices in the Miscellany, we have not
made any enumeration, but they evidently are more numerous
than the regular articles, and we presume that they may amount
to at least 2500.</p>

<p>Of party, either in politics or religion, there is no trace in our
work; of personalities there are none, except those that relate to
priority of claims or other rights of individuals. Of these vindications
the number is not great, and we could heartily have wished
that there had been no occasion for any.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During twenty years from the inception of this Journal, the
editor labored alone, although overtures for editorial coöperation
had been made to him by gentlemen commanding his confidence
and esteem, and who would personally have been very acceptable.
It was, however, his opinion that the unity of purpose and action
so essential to the success of such a work were best secured by
<i>individuality</i>; but he made every effort, and not without success,
to conciliate the good will and to secure the assistance of gentlemen
eminent in particular departments of knowledge. On the
title page of No. 1, Vol. xxxiv, published in July, 1838, a new
name is introduced: the individual to whom it belongs having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
been for several years more or less concerned in the management
of the Journal, and from his education, position, pursuits and
taste, as well as from affinity, being almost identified with the
editor, he seemed to be quite a natural ally, and his adoption into
the editorship was scarcely a violation of individual unity. His
assistance has proved to be very important:&ndash;his near relation
to the senior editor prevents him from saying more, while justice
does not permit him to say less.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to our readers to know something of the
patronage of the Journal. It has never reached one thousand paying
subscribers, and has rarely exceeded seven or eight hundred&ndash;for
many years it fluctuated between six and seven hundred.</p>

<p>It has been far from paying a reasonable editorial compensation;
often it has paid nothing, and at present it does little more than
pay its bills. The number of engravings and the extra labor in
printer's composition, cause it to be an expensive work, while its
patronage is limited.</p>

<p>It has a large gratuitous distribution, both at home and abroad,
and an extensive good-will exchange with works often having
no particular bearing upon its peculiar objects. It has incurred a
heavy extra expenditure in reprinting exhausted numbers, for the
purpose of furnishing entire sets of the work. No application for
an entire set has ever yet been disappointed, and complete sets of
the volumes are to be found in many institutions and in the hands
of many individuals, both in Europe and in the United States.
Entire sets have often been presented gratuitously to our infant
colleges and to scientific institutions and distinguished individuals
in Europe. A few remain on hand, and it is our intention
to furnish them as long as we can afford to republish, or can
repurchase numbers that have run out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The series of volumes must ever form a work of permanent
interest on account of its exhibiting the progress of American
science during the long period which it covers. Comparing 1817<a id="rn_3" name="rn_3" href="#fn_3"><span class="noteref">3</span></a>
with 1847, we mark on this subject a very gratifying change.
The cultivators of science in the United States were then few&ndash;now
they are numerous. Societies and associations of various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
names, for the cultivation of natural history, have been instituted
in very many of our cities and towns, and several of them have
been active and efficient in making original observations and
forming collections. The American Philosophical Society at
Philadelphia, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at Boston,
and the Academy of Natural Sciences also at Philadelphia,
numbered distinguished names among their members, and had
published valuable volumes of Transactions before our publication
began. The Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences had also
published a single volume as early as 1813. Since that time the
Lyceum of Natural History of New York, the Boston Society
of Natural History, the Albany Institute, and the Maryland Academy
of Sciences have stood prominent among associations of a
like nature, and their memoirs now constitute an important item
in our scientific history. Other associations for the departments
of history and ethnography have also published memoirs; and we
must not omit to mention the American Geological Society, and
the Geological Society of Pennsylvania, which has issued one
valuable volume.</p>

<p>Of scientific collections we may say, that in the Institution
from which we date these remarks, going back only fourteen
years from the issuing of our first number, the entire mineralogical
and geological collection of the college was transported to
Philadelphia in one small box, and there, for lack of information
elsewhere, the specimens were named by the late Dr. Adam
Seybert, then fresh from the celebrated school of Werner at
Freiburg in Germany, perhaps the only man then in this country
who could be regarded as a mineralogist scientifically trained.
Now, mineralogy and geology are familiar to our legislators and
our youth; and the institution which sent forth its little box of
unknown mineral treasures, unfolds to its pupils and the world
a magnificent collection not surpassed, if equalled, in the United
States.</p>

<p>Boston, which at our earliest date presented only the limited
collection of the Linnæan Society, now opens to the student
a rich and beautiful museum of natural history; and Harvard
University at Cambridge has a fine botanical garden under an able
and zealous botanist&ndash;a well furnished and successful observatory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
and a rich collection of minerals and fossils, including a skeleton
of the Mastodon, which is rivalled only by the specimen of unexampled
magnitude and perfection, in the private museum of Dr.
John C. Warren in Boston.</p>

<p>Philadelphia may also boast of her cabinets of natural history,
public and private: and one of the noblest collections of birds in
the world,<a id="rn_4" name="rn_4" href="#fn_4"><span class="noteref">4</span></a> bestowed on his country by Mr. Wilson of Delaware,
has been, within a few months, added to the valuable collections
of the Academy of Natural Sciences at that place.</p>

<p>When we began our Journal, not one of the States had been
surveyed in relation to its geology and natural history; now those
that have not been explored are few in number. State collections
and a United States Museum hold forth many allurements
to the young naturalist, as well as to the archæologist and the
student of his own race. The late Exploring Expedition with
the National Institute, has enriched the capital with treasures
rarely equalled in any country, and the Smithsonian Institution
recently organized at Washington, is about to begin its labors
for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the American Association of
Geologists and Naturalists&ndash;composed of individuals assembled
from widely separate portions of the Union&ndash;by the seven sessions
which it has held, and by its rich volume of reports, has
produced a concentration and harmony of effort which promise
happy results, especially as, like the British Association, it visits
different towns and cities in its annual progress.</p>

<p>Astronomy now lifts its exploring tubes from the observatories
of many of our institutions. Even the Ohio, which within the
memory of the oldest living men, rolled along its dark waters
through interminable forests, or received the stains of blood
from deadly Indian warfare, now beholds on one of its most
beautiful hills, and near its splendid city, a permanent observatory
with a noble telescope sweeping the heavens, by the hand of
a zealous and gifted observer. At Washington also, under the powerful
patronage of the general government, an excellent observatory
has been established, and is furnished with superior instruments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
under the direction of a vigilant and well instructed astronomer&ndash;seconded
by able and zealous assistants.</p>

<p>Here also (in Yale College) successful observations have been
made with good instruments, although no permanent building
has been erected for an Observatory.</p>

<p>We only give single examples by way of illustration, for the
history of the progress of science in the United States, and of
institutions for its promotion, during the present generation,
would demand a volume. It is enough for our purpose that
science is understood and valued, and the right methods of
prosecuting it are known, and the time is at hand when its moral
and intellectual uses will be as obvious as its physical applications.
Nor is it to be forgotten that we have awakened an
European interest in our researches: general science has been
illustrated by treasures of facts drawn from this country, and our
discoveries are eagerly sought for and published abroad.</p>

<p>While with our co-workers<a id="rn_5" name="rn_5" href="#fn_5"><span class="noteref">5</span></a> in many parts of our broad land,
we rejoice in this auspicious change, we are far from arrogating
it to ourselves. Multiplied labors of many hands have produced
the great result. In the place which we have occupied, we have
persevered despite of all discouragements, and may, with our
numerous coadjutors, claim some share in the honors of the day.
We do not say that our work might not have been better done&ndash;but
we may declare with truth that we have done all in our
power, and it is something to have excited many others to effort
and to have chronicled their deeds in our annals. Let those that
follow us labor with the like zeal and perseverance, and the good
cause will continue to advance and prosper. It is the cause of
truth&ndash;science is only embodied and systematized truth, and in the
beautiful conception of our noble Agassiz&ndash;"<i>it tells the thoughts
of God</i>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although we are writing a preface to our first series already closed,
we may, without impropriety, say something of the Second
Series now in successful progress. It began on the first of January,
1846; instead of being quarterly like the First Series, it appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
once in two months&ndash;six times in a year, giving two volumes
of 450 pages each. In this Series, the name of a third
editor appears upon the title page, and the remarks which have
been already made are, in their spirit and almost in the letter,
applicable in the present instance. The <i>unity</i> is still preserved,
and both counsel and action&ndash;favored by juxta-position and constant
intercourse&ndash;are almost as if one individual presided alone.
It will be perceived, therefore, that we have not departed from
the principle which has governed us from the beginning, and
when our mantle shall fall, there are those at hand who may, if it
be worth the effort, arrest it in its descent and wear it more worthily
than we have done.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The portrait prefixed to this volume was engraved for a very
different purpose and for others than the patrons of this Journal.
It has been suggested by friends, whose judgment we are accustomed
to respect, that it ought to find a place here, since it
is regarded as an authentic, although, perhaps, a rather austere
resemblance. In yielding to this suggestion, it may be sufficient
to quote the sentiment of Cowper on a similar occasion, who
remarked&ndash;"that after a man has, for many years, turned his
mind <i>inside out</i> before the world, it is only affectation to attempt
to hide his face."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In tracing back the associations of many gone-by years, a host
of thoughts rush in, and pensive remembrance of the dead who
have labored with us casts deep shadows into the vista through
which we view the past.</p>

<p>Anticipation of the hour of discharge, when our summons
shall arrive, gives sobriety to thought and checks the confidence
which health and continued power to act might naturally inspire,
were we not reproved, almost every day, by the death of some coeval,
co-worker, companion, friend or patron. This very hour is
saddened by such an event,&ndash;but we will continue to labor on,
and strive to be found at our post of duty, until there is nothing
more for us to do; trusting our hopes for a future life in the
hands of him who placed us in the midst of the splendid garniture
of this lower world, and who has made not less ample provision
for another and a better.</p>

with <a href="#Botany"><i>Botany</i></a>.</p>

<p>Obituary notices are collected together under <i><a href="#Obituary">Obituary</a></i>.</p>

<p>The references under authors' names, when numerous, are sometimes
alphabetized, or distributed according to subjects, but often follow the
order of the volumes.</p>

<p>Works reviewed are mentioned under the names of their authors, and
also under the word <i><a href="#Works">Works</a></i>.</p>

<p>When an article is illustrated by figures or plates, the fact is noted
by adding to the number of the page, the letter f.</p>

<p>A Supplement, (<a href="#Page_317">page 317</a>,) is added, containing some omitted references.</p>

<p>The list of plates and wood cuts, (<a href="#Page_323">page 323</a>,) is arranged according
to volumes, and the page or article is mentioned which each illustrates.
The numbers in this list indicate the proper order of succession in each
volume, and not the numbers that may appear on the plates.</p>

<p>"<i>Extreme cold</i>" of 1766-7.&ndash;In Volume xxviii, at page 183, are
quoted observations at New Haven, Conn., on the cold of 1766, 1767,
stated in "<i>degrees of extreme cold</i>." This phrase being obscure, was
then erroneously interpreted to be equivalent to "<i>degrees below zero</i>."
An examination of the MS. Meteorological Journal of Pres. Stiles, shows
that the words "<i>extreme cold</i>" were marked on the thermometer
(which was probably Hauksbee's) as comprehending a region, on the
scale, of 20° H., viz. from 85° to 105°; 100° H. being equal to 0° Fahr.
Immediately above this region of <i>extreme cold</i>, is a region of 20°
marked "<i>frost</i>," extending from 65° to 85° H. (65° H. being equal
to +32° Fahr.) The cold at New Haven ascertained from other sources
was, Dec. 31, 1766, -1° F., Jan. 1, 1767, -8&frac12; F., Jan. 2, -9&frac34; F.,
which numbers correspond very nearly with the statements in <i>extreme
cold</i>, when explained on the principles above mentioned. The cold of
Jan. 5, 1835, at New Haven, still appears to be more intense than any
previously recorded here.</p>

<p><i>East Bridgewater Meteorite.</i>&ndash;I have examined the East Bridgewater,
Mass., Meteorite referred to in vol. xxxii, p. 395, of this Journal,
and find the specimens which were collected to be nothing more than
old slag from an iron-furnace, which had been spread over the field in
former times. Some rounded balls of these had been washed up during
the severe thunder shower during which the fall was believed to have
occurred. One of the specimens submitted to my inspection was from
the identical parcel collected by the lad with whom the report originated.
Its surface was much invested, (and its substance partially penetrated)
with rootlets of grasses!</p>

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
